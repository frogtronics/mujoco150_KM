Notes: 

Muscle groupings:

axialGroup={"LCIprox","LCImid","LCIdist","RCIprox","RCImid","RCIdist"};
ilgroup={"LIL0","LIL1","LIL2","LIL3","RIL0","RIL1","RIL2","RIL3"};
femProtractionGroup={"LIEprox","LIEdist"};
femRetractionGroup={"LSM","LIFB","LOE"};



Filenames are muscles with _ degree of freedom for that given moment arm
L = left; R = right; A = averaged L/R
e.g.
LCR_hipL  means left cruralis moment arm about left hip

LAR - long axis rotation
FE - Flexion extension
AA - Abduction adduction

Note: static femur angle does not impact moment arms of intrinsic pelvic muscles
Likewise, static ISX angle does not impact moment arms of leg muscles
