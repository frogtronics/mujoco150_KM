Notes: 

Filenames are muscles with _ degree of freedom for that given moment arm
L = left; R = right; A = averaged L/R
e.g.
LCR_hipL  means left cruralis moment arm about left hip

LAR - long axis rotation
FE - Flexion extension
AA - Abduction adduction

Note: static femur angle does not impact moment arms of intrinsic pelvic muscles
Likewise, static ISX angle does not impact moment arms of leg muscles
