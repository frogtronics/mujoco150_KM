Fixed (?) Issues:
SM muscle
w_left_SM_side in wrong place.  Moved it. (Line 385)

AM_crv muscle:
w_left_AM_fem wrapping cylinder was too thin. Made thicker (Line 391)

IImed:
muscle not constrained enough proximally, added a via point in femur body
left_II_via_prox1 (Line 422)

GR
origin was too close to wrapping surface (if any tendon routing points enter a wrapping
surface the wrapping breaks).  Moved the origin further into the bone (L315)

PY
Muscle collides with ilium and creates discontinuity in plots.  Although this is the correct behaviour for the model, it should not be so abrupt.  Tried to make this smoother by enlarging the wrapping surface (inside the ilium) -did'nt work (Line 270)
Then tried to put a via point near the ilium - smooths out the curves, but is this correct? (L271)  To disable this via point comment out Line 1064
