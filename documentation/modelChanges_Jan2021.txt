Fixed (?) Issues:
SM muscle
w_left_SM_side in wrong place.  Moved it. (Line 385)

AM_crv muscle:
w_left_AM_fem wrapping cylinder was too thin. Made thicker (Line 391)

IImed:
muscle not constrained enough proximally, added a via point in femur body
left_II_via_prox1 (Line 422)

GR
origin was too close to wrapping surface (if any tendon routing points enter a wrapping
surface the wrapping breaks).  Moved the origin further into the bone (L315)
