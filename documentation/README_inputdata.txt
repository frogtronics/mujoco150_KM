Input data is in terms of quaternions for ..models/Kassina/Kassina.xml model
See README_workflow.txt for information on how these relate to raw kinematics data

Note some important changes were made to the model files in Oct, 2020 by C. Richards including mapModel.cpp which opens a model file and writes a "map file" that names each dof in order, in case changes to the model are made and tested.  There is a corresponding mapfile_k for kinematics which names each dof for the kinematics.  This is not meant to change.  Importantly, all joints in the model file must be preceded with "j_" for the mathematica analysis code to work.

Hop = jumping data (recorded by L. Porro, E. Eberhard, 2016 [1])
Run = walking data (recorded by A. Collings, L. Porro, K. Chadwick, C. Richards, 2015 [1,2])
Ref = for reference poses.  
ref 00 is the position of the frog in which it was scanned.
ref 01 is the frog in scan pose, but with the knee extending at a constant rate (all other joints motionless)
ref 02 same as ref01 but with hip extension rather than knee
ref 03 knee and hip extending simultaneously


Test = for testing (generated by MJModelling_testLateralRotation.nb)
frog in null pose (all joint angles = 0 unless otherwise noted)
KM00_TST_01  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 0 degrees.
KM00_TST_02  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 45 degrees.
KM00_TST_03  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 90 degrees.
KM00_TST_04  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 135 degrees.
KM00_TST_05  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 0 degrees, IS joint flexed ventrally to 22 deg
KM00_TST_06  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 45 degrees, IS joint flexed ventrally to 22 deg
KM00_TST_07  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 90 degrees, IS joint flexed ventrally to 22 deg
KM00_TST_08  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 135 degrees, IS joint flexed ventrally to 22 deg
KM00_TST_09  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 0 degrees, IS joint flexed ventrally to 45 deg
KM00_TST_10  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 45 degrees, IS joint flexed ventrally to 45 deg
KM00_TST_11  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 90 degrees, IS joint flexed ventrally to 45 deg
KM00_TST_12  Pelvis rotating, left leg held at 135 degrees, IS joint flexed ventrally to 45 deg




----old test data (not used) -see old DATA folders-------
test00 is a copy of KM06_HOP_08 quaternions file sent by ChrisB's 
test01 is the quaternion file for KM06_HOP_08 generated by Enrico's changeAngles.cpp 
(Modified by ChrisR) to confirm that file saving works properly
test03 same as ref 2, but with modified tendon path of CR (Kassina_test.xml) - Version 1
test04 same as test03, but with modified tendon path of CR (Kassina_test.xml) - Version 2
test05 same as test04, but with modified tendon path of CR (Kassina_test.xml) - Version 3
test06 same as test05, but with altered knee origin (Kassina_test_06.xml) - Version 1 
test07 altered knee origin only (i.e. original CR path)
---------------------------------------------------------

"fixed" refers to hypothetical pelvis which has been mathematically "glued" such that there is no lateral rotation [3].  For all other cases, all global translation/rotational motions of the body have been removed, but otherwise no further alterations to kinematics.  See publications for details.

NOTE: You can make a list of muscle paths to highlight. This is done by modifying the muscle_highlight.txt.  This will colour only those paths and all other muscles will be transparent (they will still be present in the model).  For an example, see muscle_highlight_example.txt (this is just to show you how to write the file - the example file is ignored by the simulator).
