Input data is in terms of quaternions for ..models/Kassina/Kassina.xml model
See README_workflow.txt for information on how these relate to raw kinematics data

Hop = jumping data (recorded by L. Porro, E. Eberhard, 2016 [1])
Run = walking data (recorded by A. Collings, L. Porro, K. Chadwick, C. Richards, 2015 [1,2])
Ref = for reference poses.  
ref 00 is the position of the frog in which it was scanned.
ref 01 is the frog in scan pose, but with the knee extending at a constant rate (all other joints motionless)
ref 02 same as ref01 but with hip extension rather than knee
ref 03 same as ref 2, but with modified tendon path of CR (experimental) - Version 1
ref 04 same as ref 3, but with modified tendon path of CR (experimental) - Version 2
ref 05 same as ref 4, but with modified tendon path of CR (experimental) - Version 3
ref 06 same as ref 5, but with altered knee origin (Version 1)

Test = for testing
test00 is a copy of KM06_HOP_08 quaternions file sent by ChrisB's 
test01 is the quaternion file for KM06_HOP_08 generated by Enrico's changeAngles.cpp (Modified by ChrisR) to confirm that file saving works properly

"fixed" refers to hypothetical pelvis which has been mathematically "glued" such that there is no lateral rotation [3].  For all other cases, all global translation/rotational motions of the body have been removed, but otherwise no further alterations to kinematics.  See publications for details.

NOTE: You can make a list of muscle paths to highlight. This is done by modifying the muscle_highlight.txt.  This will colour only those paths and all other muscles will be transparent (they will still be present in the model).  For an example, see muscle_highlight_example.txt (this is just to show you how to write the file - the example file is ignored by the simulator).
