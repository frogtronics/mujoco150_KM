Input data is in terms of quaternions for ..models/Kassina/Kassina.xml model
Hop = jumping data (recorded by L. Porro, E. Eberhard, 2016 [1])
Run = walking data (recorded by A. Collings, L. Porro, K. Chadwick, C. Richards, 2015 [1,2])

0 is control condition (all global translation/rotational motions of the body have been removed, but otherwise no further alterations to kinematics)
"fixed" refers to hypothetical pelvis which has been mathematically "glued" such that there is no lateral rotation [3]
